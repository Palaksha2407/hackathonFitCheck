# hackathonFitCheck
Hello everyone! 

We have created a website named fitcheck  with an intent to make you aware of your health and providing with some tips so that you could ensure early diagnosis to improve access to healthcare.
Also, you would be introduced to an interesting section of chatbot where you have to answer some interesting questions. 
So let's get started... 

So first let's go to fitness check tab, Ok so here as we can see 
Guys, given below  are two segments: physical fitness and psychological fitness

So let's check both the sections

So according to  BMI calculated in whatever category it will fall you will be given some health and diet tips according like this ... 

Now let's go to our next section which is psychological fitness:As we can see this is mainly a chatbot which will engage you into a fun talk and will relax you .... Lest see the demo.
